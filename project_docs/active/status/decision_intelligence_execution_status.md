# Decision Intelligence Execution Status

This is the short active status file. Implementation history belongs in completed records or archive, not in this active gate document.

Detailed history:

## Current Truth

Decision Intelligence V3 is active. AI Chat remains the primary work surface for normal answers, charting, exploration, decision output, artifact inspection, and exports.

The Decisions window remains secondary. Saved DecisionAssets support immutable historical review and must not be presented as live data, final recommendations, predictions, simulations, optimizers, causal proof, or autonomous decisions.

## Current Project Gate

No Decision Intelligence implementation phase is active.

Status: **Phase 2 — Decision Review Fullscreen Viewer: COMPLETE — USER ACCEPTED**

The saved-asset review overlay is implemented in `frontend/frontend/src/features/ai/AIShell.jsx`. It opens an existing immutable DecisionAsset in an app-scoped full-viewport dialog, reuses the existing Decision Review renderer, preserves the observational-only snapshot, and does not add persistence, editing, comparison, sharing, or live refresh. The user completed browser acceptance.
