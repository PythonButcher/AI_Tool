# Decision Intelligence Execution Status

This is the short active status file. It should stay readable in under two minutes. Implementation history belongs in archive, not in this active gate document.

Detailed history:

## Current Truth

Decision Intelligence V3 is active.

AI Chat is the primary work surface. Existing AI Chat behavior must remain: normal answers, charting, exploration, decide mode, artifact inspection, and exports.

Decision Intelligence is being unified into AI Chat's results pane. The Decisions window is not deleted, but its intended role is secondary after the AI Chat output flow is clear.

Completed foundations: AI Chat answer/chart protection, Dataset Trust, backend `decision_output`, frontend `decision_output` rendering, chat-native corrections, Evidence Board rendering, Decision Graph backend data foundation, Interactive Decision Graph Workspace, User Hypotheses and Graph-To-Action Flow, and Scenario Compare in the AI Chat decision output.

The old standalone Phase 4 Canonical Active Dataset handoff is superseded. Dataset truth now belongs inside Dataset Trust in the unified AI Chat decision output flow.

## Current Project Gate

Phase 10 is fully verified and complete. All legacy Decision state routing has been purged.

Current gate is **Wait for user verification or next feature instruction**.

Use this status file as the single current source of truth. Use `project_docs/active/decision_intelligence/current/ai_chat_decision_output_unification_rollout.md` for implementation details only, and use `project_docs/active/contracts/decision_objects.md` when payload details are needed.

## Latest Verified Slice

## Phase 10: Purge Legacy Decision State (Active Execution)
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (Codex & Antigravity)

**Focus:** Complete the deletion of legacy window/panel state for Decisions from the frontend `App.jsx`, `SideBar.jsx`, and `DataPane.jsx` since AI Chat handles everything natively.

**Goals:**
1. [x] Re-route `open_workspace` action to trigger the native `decision_output` review in `AIShell.jsx`.
2. [x] Delete `DESTINATIONS.DECISIONS` entirely.
3. [x] Remove `showDecisionPanel`, `decisionWorkspace`, `decisionBundle` logic from `App.jsx`.
4. [x] Ensure `Decision Graph` remains as the only standalone popout tool.

**Current Blockers:** 
- None. Fully implemented and integrated.

## Status File Discipline

Keep this file short. When a phase is fully closed and verified, move detailed slice notes to `project_docs/archive/` and leave only the current gate, the latest verified fact, and the archive pointer here.
